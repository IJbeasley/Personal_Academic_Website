Glycolysis,Cytosol,"ADP + Pi, Glucose 🍬, NAD+","ATP⚡, NADH, Pyruvate","Aerobic 🏃, Anaerobic 🏋️‍♀️",2,"2 ATP molecules are needed for glycolysis. Glycolysis produces 4 ATP making the net yield: 2 ATP             "
Kreb's Cycle / Citric Acid Cycle,Matrix of the Mitochondria,"ADP + Pi, FAD, NAD+, Oxygen 💨, Pyruvate","ATP⚡, CO2, FADH2, NADH",Aerobic 🏃,2,"Only happens if there is enough oxygen for the electron transport chain, Pyruvate is converted to Acetyl-coA in the cytosol, and then Acetyl-coA enters the Krebs Cycle / mitochondria.                       2 pyruvates yields: 6x NADH and 2x FADH2"
Electron Transport Chain,Cristae of the Mitochondria,"ADP + Pi, FADH2, NADH, Oxygen 💨","ATP⚡, FAD, NAD+, Water 🥤",Aerobic 🏃,32,* 32-34 ATP
Anaerobic Coenzyme Recycling *(doesn't really have a name),Cytosol,"NADH, Pyruvate","ADP + Pi, Ethanol + CO2 (yeast), Latic Acid (In Animals), NAD+",Anaerobic 🏋️‍♀️,0,In the absence of O2 - glycolysis leads in this anaerobic specific reaction and produces:    Lactic Acid - Humans                         Ethanol (alcohol) - yeast                       2x NADH in aerobic conditions

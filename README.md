[My Personal Website](https://isobelbeasley.com/) built using the Academic Hugo Theme + Blogdown + R. Deployed with Netlify. ðŸŽ‰

This is place where I share some of the myriad of different things Iâ€™m working on; from [academic research](https://isobelbeasley.com/research), to [science blogs](https://isobelbeasley.com/writing), to high school [teaching materials](https://isobelbeasley.com/vce-biology). I hope you find something useful in it!

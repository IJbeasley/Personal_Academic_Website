abstract: "Individuals of European ancestry disproportionately dominate participation in human genetic studies, to the detriment of scientific inquiry and the equitable translation of genomic research. One genomic study type, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, has been a valuable tool for understanding the regulatory consequences of disease associated genetic variants. However, not all associations between genotype at a given locus and variation in gene expression (eQTLs) are shared across populations. Understanding the features of these eQTLs could enable a priori prediction of eQTLs in understudied populations. \n

Here we use summary statistics from three previous multi-population eQTL studies to classify eQTLs as population-specific or shared between at least two populations (African American, European American, Indonesian etc.). We train machine learning models to predict whether an eQTL is specific to its discovery population using publicly available information on the evolutionary, functional, and expression features of these eQTLs. As per similar applications, we find trained random forest classifiers perform better than other algorithms on a held out test set of eQTLs (auROC > 0.8). \n

Features of gene conservation (e.g. LOEUF, phyloP), Gene Ontology, allele frequency and eQTL effect size have the largest importance scores in our best performing models. This result suggests these features could be used to understand gene regulatory trait differences across populations. Since current Eurocentric biases in genomic resources are likely to persist for some time, our approach could be an important step toward a more equitable understanding of gene regulation, and hence more equitable personalised medicine.

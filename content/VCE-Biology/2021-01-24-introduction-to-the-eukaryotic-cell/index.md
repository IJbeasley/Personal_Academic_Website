<aside>

<b> Note: </b> To develop the content for this page I adapted a learning plan I wrote in 2021 for VCE summer school. It's now better targeted to the 2022-2026 VCAA study design, but it is still not a perfect match for this study desgin.

Overview:

</h2>

> This page is about the wonderful ways in which the Eukaryotic cell is able to organise and coordinate complicated chemical reactions. In short, organelles and membranes.

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F">
Relevant VCAA 2022 Study Design Dot Points:    
</h2> 

Unit 3 (Outcome 1): The relationship between nucleic acids and proteins

- *the role of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and associated vesicles in the export of proteins from a cell via the protein secretory pathway*               
<br> 
<br>
<br> 

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F">

Learning Objectives:

</h2>

*By the end of this page you should be able to:* 

- Correctly label essential components of Eukaryotic cells *(plasma membrane, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles)*
- Define the roles of essential components of Eukaryotic cells *(plasma membrane, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles)*

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> Structures within the Eurkaryotic cell </h2>

<details> <summary> Describe the major differences between prokaryote and eukaryote cells.  </summary> 

<br> 
Eukaryote cells contain membrane bound organelles and a nucleus (which contains the cells DNA), whereas prokaryote cells do not contain any membrane bound organelles or a double-layered membrane around their DNA.

Try to answer the questions yourself before reading the provided answers. The questions and answers provided here are colloquial - they're not meant to be representative of exam formatting. 

<details>
    <summary> What <em> is </em> a cell? </summary>
    <br> <br> A cell is the most basic unit of life. <br><br>
</details>

<details> 
    <summary> <em> Ok, sure but what does that mean? </em> </summary>
    <br> It means that the cell is the smallest building block that all living things have in common.

<details>
         <summary> What do cells do? </summary>
         <br> <br>
         Everything you need to survive. Make proteins. Sort and organise molecules. Break down materials to obtain energy. Remove waste. Respond to infection with viruses. <b> All of it </b> 
         <br> <br>
</details>

<details> 
        <summary> How do they do <em> all </em> these roles? </summary>
        <br> <br>
        Through the magic of project management. No seriously, by having organelles cells can assign tasks, organise, sort and build materials - to perform all the jobs a cell has. We'll go into more detail about what I mean by this below. 
        <br> <br>
</details>

<details>
    <summary> Why should <em> I </em> care about cells? </summary>
    Hopefully because you're made of them. Because you need them to survive. Because they're really <em> really </em> tiny blobs of different shapes, sizes, roles, and which manage and run billions of different chemical reactions which are happening in you right now. Cells are the reason that you can be here right now reading this. Thank you cells!

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> How do organelles help Eukaryote cells do their jobs? (~15 minute activity) </h2>

Ok, imagine for a second you are cell project manager. 

The organism you are a part of has asked you to make a really big house shaped molecule made of protein bricks. The protein bricks are many different shapes and size - and make up different parts of the house. Once the protein house is build you also need to ship it to another cell. 

**How on earth are you going to deliver this project, quickly and in an organised fashion?** 

Use the organelles and their listed roles below to plan this project.

      Smooth: Site of lipid and membrane synthesis

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F">  This lesson's TL;DR </h2>

- Cells are super cool building blocks of life
- Eukaryotic cells contain organelles (membrane bound cellular structure that perform a specialised roles)
- VCAA (and your teachers) will expect you to know the roles of important organelles *(plasma membrane, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles)*

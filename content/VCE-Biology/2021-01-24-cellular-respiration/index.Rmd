<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> Learning Objectives </h2>

*By the end of this lesson you should be able to:* 

- Contrast the purpose of aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis
- List the main inputs and outputs for the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis
- List the main inputs, outputs and ATP yields for stages of cellular respiration *(glycolysis, anaerobic respiration, Kreb's cycle, electron transport chain in yeast and in animals)*
- Explain how evidence <i> (including chromosomal structure, double membrane, ribosome type) </i> supports the bacterial origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts
- (Bonus Easy) Agree it's ridiculous that life exists given the complexity of reactions it needs (photosynthesis, cellular respiration)
- (Bonus Challenge) Explain how different factors (temperature,  light, glucose availability, carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration) impact the rate of cellular respiration and photosynthesis

</h2> 

- the *main inputs, outputs and locations* of glycolysis, Krebs Cycle and electron transport chain including ATP yield (details of biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required)
- the *location, inputs and the difference in outputs* of anaerobic fermentation in animals and yeasts 
- the *factors that affect the rate of cellular respiration*: temperature, glucose availability and oxygen concentration

... this looks like a lot to know - but don't worry, it's actually not at all - it's just boring.

<h3> Important VCAA Note </h3>

> VCAA emphasises that <b> "details of the biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required" </b>

What this means that what you really need to know is: WHERE, WHAT GOES IN, WHAT COMES OUT and HOW MUCH ATP for each stage. Sooooo ... let's just focus on these aspects.

Cellular respiration equation:
</h3>

Chemical equation:

$$ 6O_{2} + C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 36ADP + 36P_{i} ‚Üí 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + 36ATP $$
Word equation:
$$ \text{Oxygen} + \text{Glucose} + \text{ADP} + \text{Inorganic Phosphorus} ‚Üí \text{Carbon Dixode} + \text{Water} + \text{ATP (avaliable energy)} $$

<h3> Most important table to remember for cellular respiration </h3>

```{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
what_to_know_for_cellular_respiration <- read_csv("../../../static/media/tables/what-to-know-for-cellular-respiration.csv")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

what_to_know_for_cellular_respiration %>% 
  knitr::kable(escape = FALSE) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "100%")

```

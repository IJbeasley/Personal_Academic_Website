## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

-  Explain how allele frequencies relate to genetic diversity of a population
-  Predict the direction of change to the level of genetic diversity in a population due to mutation, gene flow, and genetic drift (bottle neck and founder effect)
- (Bonus Challenge) List the basic steps in allopatric speciation (and apply them to unfamiliar scenarios)

üí° Associated VCAA Study Design Dot Points:               <ul> <i> 
<li> the qualitative treatment of the causes of changing allele frequencies in a population‚Äôs gene pool including types of mutations (point, frameshift, block) as a source of new alleles 
</li>
<li> 
environmental selection pressures on phenotypes as the mechanism for natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift (bottleneck and founder effects) and the biological consequences of such changes in terms of increased or reduced genetic diversity 
</li>              
<li> 
processes of evolution including through the action of mutations and different selection pressures on a fragmented population and subsequent isolating mechanisms (allopatric speciation) that prevent gene flow 
</li>      
<li> 
the manipulation of gene pools through selective breeding programs

 **Gene Pool:**

- ‚Äúthe complete set of alleles present in a population‚Äù

**Allele Frequency**

- Incidence or proportion of genes which have a particular allele within a population

**Genetic Diversity**

- Amount of variation within a gene pool
    - *How many different alleles?*
    - *What frequency do the alleles occur?*

# Species:

[What is a species? How do we know two groups of animals are different species?](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/free_text_polls/n30LWJDNU8pNanxQ33Rux?controls=none&short_poll=true)


### So how do we form multiple species from a single species?

(One way) 

1. Isolation 
2. Natural selection + Mutation
3. Lots of time / generations

... this process is called allopatrick speciation
<br> 

### Allopatric Speciation stages:

- Two populations are divided by geographic barrier with no gene flow/migration between them
- Each group experiences different selection pressures and different mutations accumulate, which allow differences in allele frequencies to develop
- Over time, the populations, if reintroduced, would be unable to produce viable fertile offspring together

<br>

# Natural selection 

## Stages:

1. Heritable VARIATION:
    
    There must be genetic variation within a population which causes phenotypic variation
    
2. Struggle to Survive:
    
     Not all members of a population will survive long enough to reproduce.
    
3.  HEREDITY and differential reproduction:
    
    Individuals with phenotypes better equipped to suit their environment/selection pressures will be more likely to survive and reproduce. These genes will be inherited by their offspring.
    
4. Change to population (genotypic / phenotypic) 
    
    Over time the more successful phenotypic trait will become more common in the population (change in allele frequency)

<br>

# Today's TL;DR

- Genetic diversity helps populations deal with changing environmental pressures (often called selective agents)
- Genetic drift (the bottleneck effect, the founder effect), natural selection all typically reduce genetic diversity
- Mutations and gene flow typically increase genetic diversity
- Point mutations are single nucleotide changes to a DNA sequence, block mutations are larger changes in to a whole segment of DNA
- In allopatric speciation there are 3 big stages:  geographic isolation, mutation and natural selection, and reintroduction

# Gene Structure

[Introductory True / False Question](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/zPyXv2khbM4Z7q2LedaTU?controls=none&short_poll=true)

<br> 

## Aspects of gene structures:

[If you were to draw a picture of a gene in an exam, what features would you need to draw?](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/free_text_polls/ZQLfZd9GuU8mrByIKt5Oj?controls=none&short_poll=true)


<details> 
<summary> Reveal features to include </summary> 

- <b> Promoter </b> (This is drawn 'upstream' of a gene ('upstream' means it is on the 5' end of a gene, i.e. closer to the START codon than to the STOP codon). It is standard to draw the promoter to the left of the gene, but as long as the promoter is closer to the START codon, then you've drawn it correctly.
- <b> START &  STOP codons </b> 
- <b> Exons &  Introns </b> Note: this aspect is not always necessary, as some genes don't have introns, but if you know a gene has introns you should draw them! If you haven't been told whether this gene has introns you might be able to get away with not drawing introns and exons ...

## Function of each aspect of gene structure: 

[Function of the promoter?](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/iwFITovmwYUuLSTQBEeKZ?controls=none&short_poll=true)

<details> <summary> Reveal promoter structure </summary> 
Site where RNA polymerase binds to start transcription
</details> 

[What is the role of an intron?](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/e4A53I86m0Nq7prunFyC4?controls=none&short_poll=true)

<details> <summary> Reveal exon and intron roles:  </summary> 
Introns are regions of the gene which are spliced out of the premRNA molecule (and so do not code for amino acids, so they are sometimes also called non-coding regions). Exons code for amino acids, so they get to 'exit' the nucleus. 
</details> 

START / STOP codon role:  Instruct ribosomes as to when to start / stop translation

## Gene Structure Drawing 
    
- When drawing a gene in a VCAA exam make sure to label the promoter, the START / STOP triplet and introns and exons. Labelling is key!

# Types of Genes

Regulatory genes: ***encode specific proteins products which regulate the level of activity of other genes*** 

Structural genes: encode specific proteins products (that don't do gene regulation tasks)

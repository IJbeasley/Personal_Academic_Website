<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> Learning Objectives: </h2>

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

- Draw the basic structure of DNA (nucleotides and the polymer)
- Explain what the following DNA features refer to: *antiparallel, redundant, universal, degenerate, gene*
- List the major similarities and differences between DNA and RNA (focusing on subunits, structure and function)

Role of DNA: To contain/store the genetic material of the cell (i.e. the code for the specific order of amino acids in assembling various proteins).

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> The Nucleotide </h2> 

What are the key components of <b> DNA nucleotides? </b> <i> (i.e. what do I need to be able to draw in an exam or sac?) </i> </b>

<details> <summary> Reveal key components </summary> 
<ul>

<li>
<b> Nitrogenous Base  </b>
<br>
<br>
In rough diagrams (like the ones you might draw in an exam), the Nitrogenous base is typically depicted as a rectangle with a triangle, or circular end. 

<br>

The triangle, or circular ends are drawn to represent complementary base pairing, whereby a student might make the C / G pairs base complementary circular patterns, and the A / T pairs complementary triangular patterns. The actual pattern or shape you draw to show complementary base pairing is not that important; the most important aspect is that the A / T bases look like they fit together, and the C / G bases have a different shape to the A / T bases, and they also look like they fit together. 
<br> 
<br>
</li>

<li>
<b> Phosphate Group </b>
<br> 
This phosphate group is negatively charged. In a rough diagram, we typically draw it as a circle.
</li>

<li>
<b> Deoxyribose Sugar  </b>
<br>
 In a rough diagram, we typically use a pentagon to represent the deoxyribose sugar, as the sugar  molecule is made up of a '5' carbon ring. 
</li>
</ul>

<br> 

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> The Doubled Stranded Polymer </h2> 

<b> How do DNA nucleotides become the double stranded DNA helix? </b> 
    
A single strand of DNA is formed via *condensation polymerisation. Nucleotides are added together to form the phosphodiester backbone releasing a water molecule as a by-product. A complementary strand to this single strand can now bind using hydrogen bonding.

<details> <summary> Reveal the differences between DNA and RNA </summary> 
<br>
RNA is a <b> short lived </b> molecule which is <b> more easily transported throughout </b> the cell.
<ul> 
There are three main classes of RNAs you should know about:  <br> <br> 
<li> mRNA: <i> "to carry specific amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis‚Äù </i> VCAA </li>
<li> rRNA: to be a <i> structural component of the ribosomes </i> and catalyse the assembly of amino acids into protein chains </li>
<li> tRNA: <i> to carry information from the nucleus to the ribosome for protein synthesis </i> VCAA </li>
</ul> 

<br><br>

DNA is a <b> long lived </b>, stable molecule which <b> resides in the nucleus </b> (in Eurokaryotic organisms).

# Today's TL;DR

- DNA is a super cool molecule that makes all of life possible
- It is a double stranded, antiparallel polymer of nucleotides
- DNA's nucleotides are comprised of a phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, nitrogenous base and a hydroxyl group
- In comparison, RNA is single stranded, and its nucleotides have a ribose sugar (and have Uracil rather than Thymine)

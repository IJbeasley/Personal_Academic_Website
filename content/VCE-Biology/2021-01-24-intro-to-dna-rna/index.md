<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> The Doubled Stranded Polymer </h2> 

<b> How do DNA nucleotides become the double stranded DNA helix? </b> 
    
A single strand of DNA is formed via *condensation polymerisation. Nucleotides are added together to form the phosphodiester backbone releasing a water molecule as a by-product. A complementary strand to this single strand can now bind using hydrogen bonding.

<details> <summary> Reveal the differences between DNA and RNA </summary> 
    - RNA is a short lived molecule which is more easily transported within the cell
        - mRNA: ***‚Äúto carry specific amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis‚Äù*** VCAA
        - rRNA: to be a ***‚Äústructural component of the ribosomes‚Äù*** and catalyse the assembly of amino acids into protein chains
        - tRNA: ***‚Äúto carry information from the nucleus to the ribosome for protein synthesis‚Äù*** VCAA
    - DNA is a long lived, stable molecule which resides in the nucleus.

# Today's TL;DR

- DNA is a super cool molecule that makes all of live possible
- DNA is a double stranded, antiparallel polymer of nucleotides
- Nucleotides are comprised of a phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, nitrogenous base and a hydroxyl group
- In comparison, RNA is single stranded, and it's nucleotides have a ribose sugar (and have Uracil rather than Thymine)

<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> Learning Objectives </h2>

*By the end of this lesson you should be able to:* 

- List the main inputs and outputs for the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis
- Explain how evidence (including chromosomal structure, double membrane, ribosome type) supports the bacterial origins of  chloroplasts
- (Bonus Easy) Agree it's ridiculous that life exists given the complexity of reactions it needs 
- (Bonus Challenge) Explain how different factors (temperature, light, glucose availability, carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration) impact the rate of cellular respiration

Relevant VCAA 2022 Study Design Dot Points:    
</h2> 

- *inputs, outputs and locations* of the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis in C3 plants (details of biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required) 
- the *role of Rubisco in photosynthesis*, including adaptations of C3, C4 and CAM plants to maximise the efficiency of photosynthesis
- the *factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis*: light availability, water availability, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration

... this looks like a lot to know - but don't worry, it's actually not at all - it's just boring.

<h3> Important VCAA Note </h3>

> VCAA emphasises that <b> "details of the biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required" </b>

What this means that what you really need to know is: WHERE, WHAT GOES IN, and WHAT COMES OUT. Sooooo ... let's just focus on these aspects.

Note: This page is adapted from a learning plan + notes I used to teach online VCE summer school 2021. It‚Äôs now been (mostly) adapted for the 2022-2026 VCAA study design.

Learning Objectives
</h2>
<p><em>By the end of this lesson you should be able to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>List the main inputs and outputs for the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis</li>
<li>Explain how evidence (including chromosomal structure, double membrane, ribosome type) supports the bacterial origins of chloroplasts</li>
<li>(Bonus Easy) Agree it‚Äôs ridiculous that life exists given the complexity of reactions it needs</li>
<li>(Bonus Challenge) Explain how different factors (temperature, light, glucose availability, carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration) impact the rate of cellular respiration</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br></p>
<h2 style="color:#D32F2F">
Relevant VCAA 2022 Study Design Dot Points:
</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>inputs, outputs and locations</em> of the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis in C3 plants (details of biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required)</li>
<li>the <em>role of Rubisco in photosynthesis</em>, including adaptations of C3, C4 and CAM plants to maximise the efficiency of photosynthesis</li>
<li>the <em>factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis</em>: light availability, water availability, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Ä¶ this looks like a lot to know - but don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs actually not at all - it‚Äôs just boring.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>
Important VCAA Note
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>VCAA emphasises that <b> ‚Äúdetails of the biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required‚Äù </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means that what you really need to know is: WHERE, WHAT GOES IN, and WHAT COMES OUT. Sooooo ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just focus on these aspects.</p>

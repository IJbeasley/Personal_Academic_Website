## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

- [ ]  Contrast the purpose of aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis
- [ ]  List the main inputs and outputs for the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis
- [ ]  List the main inputs, outputs and ATP yields for stages of cellular respiration *(glycolysis, anaerobic respiration, Kreb's cycle, electron transport chain in yeast and in animals)*
- [ ]  Explain how evidence ****(including chromosomal structure, double membrane, ribosome type) supports the bacterial origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts
    - [ ]  (Bonus Easy) Agree it's ridiculous that life exists given the complexity of reactions it needs (photosynthesis, cellular respiration)
    - [ ]  (Bonus Challenge) Explain how different factors ****(temperature,  light, glucose availability, carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration) impact the rate of cellular respiration and photosynthesis

    -*the purpose of photosynthesis                                                                                                            -the purpose of cellular respiration                                                                                                 -chloroplasts as the site of photosynthesis, an overview of their structure and evidence of their bacterial origins                                                                                                                    -mitochondria as the site of aerobic cellular respiration, an overview of their structure and evidence of their bacterial origins                                                                                                  -inputs and outputs of the light dependent and light independent (Calvin cycle) stages of photosynthesis in C3 plants                                                                                                               -the main inputs and outputs of the Krebs (citric acid) cycle and electron transport chain including ATP yield                                                                                                                            -the location of, and the inputs and outputs of, glycolysis including ATP yield                          -the location of anaerobic cellular respiration, its inputs and the difference in outputs between animals and yeasts including ATP yield*                               

    # Important VCAA Notes:

    > VCAA emphasises that ***"details of the biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required"                                                                                                        All you need to know is: WHERE, WHAT GOES IN, WHAT COMES OUT and HOW MUCH ATP*** for each stage ****(how much ATP is only for cellular respiration)*

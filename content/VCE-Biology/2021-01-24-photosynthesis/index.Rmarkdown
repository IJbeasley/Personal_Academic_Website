<b> Note </b>: This page is adapted from a learning plan + notes I used to teach online VCE summer school 2021. It's now been (mostly) adapted for the 2022-2026 VCAA study design. 
</aside>

<aside> <b> 
Relevant VCAA 2022 Study Design Dot Points:    
</b>
<ul> <i>
<li>
<b> inputs, outputs and locations </b> of the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis in C3 plants (details of biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required) 
</li>
<li>
the <b> role of Rubisco in photosynthesis </b>, including adaptations of C3, C4 and CAM plants to maximise the efficiency of photosynthesis
</li>
<li>
the <b> factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis </b>: light availability, water availability, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration
</li>
</i> </ul>
<br>
... this looks like a lot to know - but don't worry, it's actually not at all - it's just boring.

## <span style="color:#D32F2F">  Learning Objectives </span>

*By the end of this lesson you should be able to:* 

- List the main inputs and outputs for the light dependent and light independent stages of photosynthesis
- Explain how evidence (including chromosomal structure, double membrane, ribosome type) supports the bacterial origins of  chloroplasts
- (Bonus Easy) Agree it's ridiculous that life exists given the complexity of reactions it needs 
- (Bonus Challenge) Explain how different factors (temperature, light, glucose availability, carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration) impact the rate of cellular respiration

### <span style="color:#D32F2F"> Important VCAA Note </span> 

> VCAA emphasises that <b> "details of the biochemical pathway mechanisms are not required" </b>

What this means that what you really need to know is: WHERE, WHAT GOES IN, and WHAT COMES OUT. Sooooo ... let's just focus on these aspects.

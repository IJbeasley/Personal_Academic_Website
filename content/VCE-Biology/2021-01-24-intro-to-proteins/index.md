<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> Learning Objectives: </h2>

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

- Draw the basic structure of an animo acid
- Define what constitutes each level of protein structure hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary)
- Give (at least three) examples of roles proteins play


Bonus Learning Objectives: 
- Bonus Easy:  Agree that proteins do many varied and important things for cells - *and hence you!*

# The Structure of Proteins

## Amino Acids 

Proteins are comprised of amino acids. 

<details> <summary>
<b> What are the key components of amino acids? <i> (i.e. what do I need to be able to draw?) </i> </b> </summary> 
<ul> 
<li>
Variable Size Chain ( R group)
</li>
<li> Amino group
</li>
<li> Carboxylic Acid Group
</li>
<li> 
Central Carbon / Hydrogen
</li>
</ul> 
</details>

## From amino acids to protein: the Hierarchy of Protein Structure

1. <details> <summary> Primary: </summary>
    The linear order/sequence of amino acids which is formed by covalent peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids 
    </details> 

1. <details> <summary> Secondary: </summary>                 <b> VCAA 2013: <i> ‚Äúthe coiled or pleated structure within the chain (including Œ±-helices and Œ≤-pleated sheets)‚Äù </i> </b> <ul> <li> caused by hydrogen-bonding between -C=O and -N-H groups (peptide linkages) within the amino acid chain
</li>
</ul>
</details> 
</details>

3. <details> <summary> Tertiary: </summary> 
    <b> VCAA 2013: <i> ‚ÄúTertiary structure: A 3D structure composed of secondary structures‚Äù </i> </b> 
    <ul>
    <li>
     formed through the interactions of various ‚ÄòR‚Äô groups within the molecule
    </li>
    <li>
      As the function of a protein is determined by its structure, the tertiary structure of a protein is essential to its functioning
        </li>
        </ul>
        </details> 
    
4. <details> <summary> Quaternary: </summary>
    <b> VCAA 2013: </i> ‚ÄúQuaternary structure: Two or more polypeptide chains joined together‚Äù </i> </b> 
    </details>

# The wide and varied roles of proteins 




# Today's TL;DR

- Proteins are 3D dimensional folder polymer comprised of amino acid
- Amino acids are comprised of a central carbon, a variable group, a carboxylic acid group and a amine group

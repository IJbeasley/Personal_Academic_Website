<h2 style="color:#D32F2F"> Learning Objectives: </h2>

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

- Draw the basic structure of an animo acid
- Define what constitutes each level of protein structure hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary)
- (Depending on your prior knowledge) Give (at least three) examples of roles proteins play


Bonus Learning Objectives: 

- Bonus Easy:  Agree that proteins do many varied and important things for cells *and therefore you!*

# The Structure of Proteins

## Amino Acids 

Proteins are comprised of amino acids. 

<details> <summary>
<b> What are the key components of amino acids? </b> <i> (i.e. what do I need to be able to draw?) </i> </summary> 
<br>
<ul> 
<li>
Variable Size Chain ( also sometimes referred to as the R group)
</li>
<li> Amino group 
</li>
<li> Carboxylic Acid Group
</li>
<li> 
Central Carbon and Hydrogen
</li>
</ul> 
</details> 

<br>

<br>

## From amino acids to protein: the Hierarchy of Protein Structure

1. <details> <summary> Primary: </summary>
   <br>
    The linear order/sequence of amino acids formed by covalent peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids.
    <br>
    </details> 

2. <details> <summary> Secondary: </summary>    
   <br>
   <b> VCAA 2013: <i> ‚Äúthe coiled or pleated structure within the chain (including Œ±-helices and Œ≤-pleated sheets)‚Äù </i> </b> 
   <ul> <li> caused by hydrogen-bonding between -C=O and -N-H groups (peptide linkages) within the amino acid chain
   
</li>
</ul>
</details>

3. <details> <summary> Tertiary: </summary> 
   <br>
   <b> VCAA 2013: <i> ‚ÄúTertiary structure: A 3D structure composed of secondary structures‚Äù </i> </b> 
    <ul>
    <li>
     formed through the interactions of various ‚ÄòR‚Äô groups within the molecule
    </li>
    </ul>
    
As the function of a protein is determined by its structure, the tertiary structure of a protein is essential to its functioning. If the protein is reshaped in any way, the protein may no longer be able to do its job. 
<br>
</details> 
    
    
4. <details> <summary> Quaternary: </summary>
   <br>
    <b> VCAA 2013: </i> ‚ÄúQuaternary structure: Two or more polypeptide chains joined together‚Äù </i> </b> 
    <br>
    </details>

# The varied roles of proteins

(i.e. the proteome)

<br>

## What is the proteome?

The entire set of proteins expressed by an organism (for more information, see the definition on [scitable](https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/proteome-297/)). 

<br>

## What are some of the proteins which make up the proteome?

- Enzymes 
- Membrane transport
- Antibodies
- Complement proteins

Can you list any more kinds of proteins? What are their roles?

Don't worry if you can't yet answer these questions easily; you undoubtedly will once you've progressed further in the course and have learnt more about the above proteins. 

Just make a note to come back when you do, and check that you can now answer the questions!

<br>
<br> 

# Today's TL;DR

- Proteins are 3D dimensional folded structures (called 'polymers') comprised of smaller repeating subunits (amino acids)
- Amino acids are comprised of a central carbon, a variable group, a carboxylic acid group and a amine group

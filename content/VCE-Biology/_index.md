# <span style="color:#D32F2F"> Resources for High School Biology Students </span>

###### <span> :triangular_flag_on_post: These resources were developed for students of  [VCE Biology](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/curriculum/vce/vce-study-designs/biology/Pages/Index.aspx), but are potentially also useful for other  Biology students in their final years of secondary or high school. </span>


## Introduction: 

> Since graduating high school in 2016 I have taught VCE Biology to many different students and for many different organisations. I've collected some the teaching material I've created in these roles below, and am currently working on expanding it for the upcoming study design (2022-). The [ASHA Lectures](https://ashalectures.org/vce-resources) webpage also has plenty of free resources to support you in your biology journey. Hopefully you find this material useful!

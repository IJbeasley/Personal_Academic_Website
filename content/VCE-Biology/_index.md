> Since graduating high school in 2016 I have taught VCE Biology for many different students and organisations. Naturally, this means I've written and spoken alot about VCE Biology. I've collected some of this material below, and plan to expand upon it for the upcoming study design (2022-). Hopefully you find this material useful - but *let me know if you have any questions, suggestions or feedback via email ([isobel.beasley@unimelb.edu.au](mailto:isobel.beasley@unimelb.edu.au>))*

## Looking for a VCE lecturer or tutor?

>At the moment, I'm not taking on any more students, but I'll still be teaching for [VCESS](https://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/getinvolved/summerschool/) and [ASHA lectures](https://ashalectures.org/). 
If you're looking for an affordable tutor and/or VCE lecturer I would highly recommend either one of those organisations. ASHA Lectures in particular runs lectures throughout the year, and if you [contact them](https://ashalectures.org/contact-us) can organise lectures and small classes for your school or a group of your friends (and it's all for charity!). So I can't be your tutor, but hey *maybe I could come talk about the wonders of biology at your school?*

# <span style="color:#D32F2F"> Resources for High School Biology Students </span>

###### <span> :triangular_flag_on_post: These resources were developed for students of  [VCE Biology](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/curriculum/vce/vce-study-designs/biology/Pages/Index.aspx), but are potentially also useful for other types of high school Biology students in their final years</span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Introduction: 

> Since graduating high school in 2016 I have taught VCE Biology for many different students and organisations. Naturally, this means I've written and spoken **a lot** about VCE Biology. I've collected some of this material below, and plan to expand it for the upcoming study design (2022-). Hopefully you find this material useful - but __*let me know if you have any questions, suggestions or feedback via email ([isobel.beasley@unimelb.edu.au](mailto:isobel.beasley@unimelb.edu.au>))*__

## Looking for a VCE lecturer or tutor?

> **Unfortunately, I don't have the time to tutor any more students.** However, I'm still teaching for [VCESS](https://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/getinvolved/summerschool/) in the summer and [ASHA lectures](https://ashalectures.org/) throughout the year. 
If you're looking for an affordable tutor and/or VCE lecturer I would highly recommend either of those organisations. ASHA Lectures runs lectures throughout the year, and if you [contact them](https://ashalectures.org/contact-us) can organise lectures and small classes for your school or a group of your friends (and it's all for charity!). So I can't be your tutor, but hey __*maybe I could come talk about the wonders of biology at your school?*__

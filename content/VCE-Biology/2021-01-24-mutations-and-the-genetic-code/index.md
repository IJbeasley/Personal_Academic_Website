## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this article you should be able to:* 

- List, and describe the major types of mutation (point, frameshift, block)
- Define the complex sounding words used to describe the genetic code (redundant, universal, triplet, codon, anti-codon)

# The Genetic code:

Codon: a trinucleotide sequence (triplet of nucleotides) in an mRNA molecule that corresponds to a specific amino acid or STOP code.

The complementary sequence to a codon is called a triplet in DNA, and an anticodon in tRNA.

## Match the Definition to the Fancy Word Quiz

VCAA sometimes refers to the genetic code as being degenerate, redundant and universal. But what do these terms refer to?

1. <details> <summary> Antiparallel </summary>
   The two DNA strands run alongside each other in the opposite direction (with respect to the 5' phosphate and the 3' hydroxyl group)
    </details> 
2. <details> <summary> Redundant </summary> 
   Multiple different DNA sequences can encode the same amino acid / protein 
   </details>
3. <details> <summary> Degenerate </summary> 
   A change to a DNA sequence doesn't always result in a change to the protein it encodes
   </details> 
4. <details> <summary> Condensation Polymerisation </summary> 
   The phosphodiester backbone of a DNA strand forms from the addition of nucleotides, resulting in the loss of water
   </details> 
5. <details> <summary> Universal </summary> 
   The same DNA sequence encodes for the same protein no matter what organism it is in
    </details> 
6. <details> <summary> Gene </summary> 
   A DNA sequence which encodes a specific protein product
   </details> 
7. <details> <summary> Complementary Base Pairing </summary> 
   Particular nucleotides only ever pair up with each other using hydrogen bonds. (e.g. A - T, G - C)

# Types of Mutation:

Mutation: any permanent change in DNA base sequence, structure or length. 

Mutations can be spontaneous (i.e. randomly occurring likely due a mistake made during cell division) or induced (i.e. occurring because another factor broke the DNA, or cause the DNA repair mechanisms to malfunction). A factor which can induce mutations is called a mutagen. 

UV Rays are example of a mutagen, which is why you should keep out of the sun!

A mutation or change to the DNA that occurs in one your body cells (more correctly known as 'somatic cells') may cause you harm by e.g. leading to cancer if a number of mutations accumulate, but are not inherited by your children  Only mutations that occur in the gametes (egg or sperm cells) which ultimately become your offspring. can be passed down.

## Point Mutation:

  A point mutation is a type of mutation in DNA or RNA in which one single nucleotide base is added, deleted or changed (usually frameshift when added/deleted)

   <details> <summary> <b> Point: </b> </summary> 
   A point mutation is a type of mutation in DNA or RNA in which one single nucleotide base is added, deleted or changed (usually frameshift when added/deleted)
   </details> 
</li>
<li>
  <details> <summary> <b> Frameshift: </b> </summary>  When the addition or deletion of one or several (not multiples of three) cause the three base DNA triplet to change (changing the amino acid sequence)
  </details> 
</li>
<li>
  <details> <summary> <b> Block: </b> </summary> 
  Changes to segments of a chromosome, resulting in large scale changes in the DNA of an organism (and typically larger changes to the phenotype of an organism)
  </details>

</ul>

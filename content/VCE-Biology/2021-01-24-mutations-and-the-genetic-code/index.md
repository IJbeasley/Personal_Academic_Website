<ul> <i> 
<li> the qualitative treatment of the causes of changing allele frequencies in a populationâ€™s gene pool including types of mutations (point, frameshift, block) as a source of new alleles, chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidyand polyploidy)
</li> 
<li> environmental selection pressures on phenotypes as the mechanism for natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift (bottleneck and founder effects) </li>
<li> and the biological consequences of such changes in terms of increased or reduced genetic diversity

# The Genetic code:

Codon: a trinucleotide (triplet of nucleotides) sequence of mRNA that corresponds to a specific amino acid (the complemtary sequence is called a triplet in DNA and anti-codon in tRNA) 

Genetic code is degenerate/redundant and universal

# Types of Mutation:

[What types of mutation are there?](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/sDq7Uf50gf5twmRhsHhXi?controls=none&short_poll=true)

- **Types of mutation:**
    - ***Point:*** A point mutation is a type of mutation in DNA or RNA in which one single nucleotide base is added, deleted or changed (usually frameshift when added/deleted)
    - ***Frameshift:*** When the addition or deletion of one or several (not multiples of three) cause the three base DNA triplet to change (changing the amino acid sequence)
    - ***Block:*** Changes to segments of a chromosome, resulting in large scale changes in the DNA of an organism (and typically larger changes to the phenotype of an organism)

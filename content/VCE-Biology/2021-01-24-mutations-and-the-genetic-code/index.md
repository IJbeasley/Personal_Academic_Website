## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 


<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Associated VCAA Study Design Dot Points:                                                                                         *- the qualitative treatment of the causes of changing allele frequencies in a populationâ€™s gene pool including types of mutations (point, frameshift, block) as a source of new alleles, chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidyand polyploidy), environmental selection pressures on phenotypes as the mechanism for natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift (bottleneck and founder effects) and the biological consequences of such changes in terms of increased or reduced genetic diversity*

</aside>

- [ ]  List the major types of mutation (point, frameshift, block)
    - [ ]  (Bonus Easy) Agree genetic diversity is important
    - [ ]  (Bonus Challenge) List the basic steps in allopatric speciation (and apply them to unfamiliar scenarios)
    
    
    
# Types of Mutation:

[What types of mutation are there?](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/sDq7Uf50gf5twmRhsHhXi?controls=none&short_poll=true)

- **Types of mutation:**
    - ***Point:*** A point mutation is a type of mutation in DNA or RNA in which one single nucleotide base is added, deleted or changed (usually frameshift when added/deleted)
    - ***Frameshift:*** When the addition or deletion of one or several (not multiples of three) cause the three base DNA triplet to change (changing the amino acid sequence)
    - ***Block:*** Changes to segments of a chromosome, resulting in large scale changes in the DNA of an organism (and typically larger changes to the phenotype of an organism)

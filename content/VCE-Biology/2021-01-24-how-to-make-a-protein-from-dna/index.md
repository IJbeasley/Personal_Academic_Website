# Gene Expression

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Your exam will absolutely have a short answer question of about 3-4 marks about the step of transcription, post transcriptional modification or / and translation. It's a really good idea to learn ~4 marks worth of steps before your final exam! <b>  
</aside>

Disclaimer: OK...so I'm not VCAA so I don't really know but a short answer question on the steps of translation and / or transcription has been in every exam since 1998 so the odds are in my favour. </b>

<br> 

## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

-  List the basic steps in transcription, RNA processing and translation in eukaryotes

# Transcription

[But first a Poll - Where do transcription and translation occur in the cell? ](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/free_text_polls/yCOpqvJNbUdz3XqNZN2hm?controls=none&short_poll=true)

### Introductory resources

### Steps:


[Try first to put the steps in order (before viewing the steps written below)](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/ranking_polls/laKc4zljY1x20YC4u7T4P?controls=none&short_poll=true)


<details>
<summary> <b> Reveal Transcription Steps </b> </summary>

- RNA polymerase binds at the promoter of the gene
- The DNA double strand is unzipped by RNA polymerase to expose the bases of the section to be copied
- RNA polymerase runs in the direction 3' to 5' *(Mnemonic: Remember we like to run shorter distances over longer distances!)*
- The template strand is copied into a complementary strand of premRNA using RNA polymerase
- The premRNA strand is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction *(Mnemonic: Remember we build towers from bigger foundations to smaller tops)*

# pre-mRNA Processing

 pre-mRNA produced from transcription undergoes post-transcriptional modification **before** it can be translated. Once post-transcriptional modification is complete, the pre-mRNA is considered 'mature mRNA', and it leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore.

*(Post transcriptional processing)*

### Steps:

[Again, let's put the steps in order before revealing the answers ....](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/0t77QByQZPJmlpvGd2Jg6?controls=none&short_poll=true)


<details>
<summary> <b> Reveal Post-transcriptional Modification Steps </b> </summary>


- Introns are removed
- Exons are joined together
- poly A-tail is added to the 3' end
- 7-methylguanosine cap is added to 5' end

# Translation

[Polls polls everywhere ...](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/free_text_polls/NO0RgwoC6ilGtx2r0Xg7z?controls=none&short_poll=true)

[Animation showing translation occurring in a free ribosome.  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkI_Vbwn14g)

### Steps:

[Once again, let's try put the steps in order ourselves before revealling any answers ...](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/ranking_polls/IYA3FZczsemrlwRC9m4z2?controls=none&short_poll=true)

<details>
<summary> <b> Reveal Translation Steps </b> </summary>

- the mRNA travels to a ribosome which reads the START codon sequence (encodes for a methionine)
- tRNA carry the correct amino acids to the ribosomes
- the anticodon on the tRNA is matched to the codon by complementary base pairing
- the amino acid on the tRNA is added to the growing polypeptide chain
- the tRNA molecule leaves, the ribosome moves a codon along the mRNA molecule
- the process repeats until the STOP codon is reached and the ribosomes dissociates from the mRNA molecule
- NOTE: It is not a protein at this stage, it needs to undergo modification and folding into its specific 3D shape

# Today's TL;DR

- The basic steps of transcription, post-transcriptional modification and translation are very important for the exam! (And for you to live!)

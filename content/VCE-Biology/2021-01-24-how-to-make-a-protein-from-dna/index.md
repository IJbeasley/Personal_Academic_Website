# Gene Expression

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Your exam will absolutely have a short answer question of about 3-4 marks about the step of transcription, post transcriptional modification or / and translation. It's a really good idea to learn ~4 marks worth of steps before your final exam! <b>  
</aside>

Disclaimer: OK...so I'm not VCAA so I don't really know but a short answer question on the steps of translation and / or transcription has been in every exam since 1998 so the odds are in my favour. </b>

<br> 

## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

-  List the basic steps in transcription, RNA processing and translation in eukaryotes

# Transcription

The process of making an pre-mRNA molecule from a gene (DNA).

<li> RNA polymerase binds at the promoter of the gene </li>
</li> The DNA double strand is unzipped by RNA polymerase to expose the bases of the section to be copied </li>
<li> RNA polymerase runs in the direction 3' to 5' <i> (Mnemonic: Remember we like to run shorter distances over longer distances!) </i> </li>
<li> The template strand is copied into a complementary strand of premRNA using RNA polymerase </li>
<li> The premRNA strand is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction <i> (Mnemonic: Remember we build towers from bigger foundations to smaller tops) </i> </li>

# Post transcriptional processing

pre-mRNA produced from transcription undergoes post-transcriptional modification **before** it can be translated. Once post-transcriptional modification is complete, the pre-mRNA is considered 'mature mRNA', and it leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore.

<br>
<br> 


Splicing is an important step in this process for Eurokaryotic organisms. In splicing some parts of the pre-mRNA molecule are excised ('introns'), so

<details>  <summary> Explanation </summary>
<br>
Transcription alone will lead to a pre-mRNA molecule that is the same length as the coding section of the gene (meaning - not including any regulatory components of a gene). However, in post-transcriptional processing in Eurkaryotic organisms the pre-mRNA molecule is 'spliced' (ome parts of the pre-mRNA molecule are excised), and lots of As are added to the end. Thus, the processed mRNA molecule that results from this process is no longer the same length as the original sequence coded in the DNA.

<ul>
<li> the mRNA travels to a ribosome which reads the START codon sequence (encodes for a methionine) </li>
<li> tRNA carry the correct amino acids to the ribosomes </li>
<li> the anticodon on the tRNA is matched to the codon by complementary base pairing </li>
<li> the amino acid on the tRNA is added to the growing polypeptide chain </li>
<li> the tRNA molecule leaves, the ribosome moves a codon along the mRNA molecule </li>
<li> the process repeats until the STOP codon is reached and the ribosomes dissociates from the mRNA molecule. NOTE: It is not a protein at this stage, it needs to undergo modification and folding into its specific 3D shape.

# Today's TL;DR

- The basic steps of transcription, post-transcriptional modification and translation are very important for the exam! (And for you to live!)

## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

- Draw the basic structure of DNA (nucleotides and the polymer)
- Explain what the following DNA features refer to: *antiparallel, redundant, universal, degenerate, gene*
- Define what constitutes each level of protein structure hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary)
-List the major similarities and differences between DNA and RNA (focusing on subunits, structure and function)
- (Bonus Easy) Agree that proteins do many varied and important things for cells - *and hence you! (Also DNA is very cool)*

## The Nucleotide

<b> What are the key components of DNA nucleotides? <i> (i.e. what do I need to be able to draw?) </i> </b>

<details> <summary> Reveal key components </summary> 
    - Nitrogenous Base
    - Phosphate Group (Negatively Charged)
    - Deoxyribose Sugar
</details> 

<br> 

## The Doubled Stranded Polymer

<b> How do DNA nucleotides become the double stranded DNA helix? </b> 
    
A single strand of DNA is formed via *condensation polymerisation. Nucleotides are added together to form the phosphodiester backbone releasing a water molecule as a by-product. A complementary strand to this single strand can now bind using hydrogen bonding.

<details> <summary> Reveal the differences between DNA and RNA </summary> 
    - RNA is a short lived molecule which is more easily transported within the cell
        - mRNA: ***‚Äúto carry specific amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis‚Äù*** VCAA
        - rRNA: to be a ***‚Äústructural component of the ribosomes‚Äù*** and catalyse the assembly of amino acids into protein chains
        - tRNA: ***‚Äúto carry information from the nucleus to the ribosome for protein synthesis‚Äù*** VCAA
    - DNA is a long lived, stable molecule which resides in the nucleus.

# The Structure of Proteins

## Amino Acids 

Proteins are comprised of amino acids. 

<details> <summary>
<b> What are the key components of amino acids? <i> (i.e. what do I need to be able to draw?) </i> </b> </summary> 
<ul> 
<li>
Variable Size Chain ( R group)

<li> Amino group
</li>
<li> Carboxylic Acid Group
</li>
<li> 
Central Carbon / Hydrogen
</li>
</ul>

# Today's TL;DR

- DNA is a super cool molecule that makes all of live possible
- DNA is a double stranded, antiparallel polymer of nucleotides
- Nucleotides are comprised of a phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, nitrogenous base and a hydroxyl group
- In comparison, RNA is single stranded, and it's nucleotides have a ribose sugar (and have Uracil rather than Thymine)
- Proteins are 3D dimensional folder polymer comprised of amino acid
- Amino acids are comprised of a central carbon, a variable group, a carboxylic acid group and a amine group

## The Fancy Terms about DNA to know for the VCE exam: 
1. Antiparallel
    - The two DNA strands run alongside each other in the opposite direction (with respect to the 5' phosphate and the 3' hydroxyl group)
2. Redundant
   - Multiple different DNA sequences can encode the same amino acid / protein
3. Degenerate
   - A change to a DNA sequence doesn't always result in a change to the protein it encodes
4. Condensation Polymerisation
   - The phosphodiester backbone of a DNA strand forms from the addition of nucleotides, resulting in the loss of water
5. Universal
    - The same DNA sequence encodes for the same protein no matter what organism it is in
6. Gene
   - A DNA sequence which encodes a specific protein product
7. Complementary Base Pairing
   - Particular nucleotides only ever pair up with each other using hydrogen bonds. (e.g. A - T, G - C)

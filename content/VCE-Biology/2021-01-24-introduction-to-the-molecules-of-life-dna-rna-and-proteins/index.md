## Learning Objectives:

*By the end of this session you should be able to:* 

- Draw the basic structure of DNA (nucleotides and the polymer)
- Explain what the following DNA features refer to: *antiparallel, redundant, universal, degenerate, gene*
- Define what constitutes each level of protein structure hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary)
-List the major similarities and differences between DNA and RNA (focusing on subunits, structure and function)
- (Bonus Easy) Agree that proteins do many varied and important things for cells - *and hence you! (Also DNA is very cool)*

# The Structure of DNA

[Video showing the location and structure of DNA in the nucleus. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hk9jct2ozY)


### DNA Nucleotide

- What are the key components of DNA nucleotides? *(i.e. what do I need to be able to draw?)*
    - Nitrogenous Base
    - Phosphate Group (Negatively Charged)
    - Deoxyribose Sugar

### DNA Doubled Stranded Polymer

- What are the key features of the DNA Polymer? *(i.e. what do I need to be able to draw?)*
    - Antiparallel
    - Complementary Base Pairing
    - Nucleotides
    - Phosphodiester backbone
    
- How do DNA nucleotides become the double stranded DNA helix?
    
A single strand of DNA is formed via *condensation polymerisation. Nucleotides are added together to form the phosphodiester backbone releasing a water molecule as a by-product. A complementary strand to this single strand can now bind using hydrogen bonding. 

    

# RNA and DNA

[What are the differences between DNA and RNA?](https://embed.polleverywhere.com/discourses/bnf9RhrM1atuCpYsq5P2E?controls=none&short_poll=true)

- **Differences between DNA and RNA**
    - RNA is a short lived molecule which is more easily transported within the cell
        - mRNA: ***‚Äúto carry specific amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis‚Äù*** VCAA
        - rRNA: to be a ***‚Äústructural component of the ribosomes‚Äù*** and catalyse the assembly of amino acids into protein chains
        - tRNA: ***‚Äúto carry information from the nucleus to the ribosome for protein synthesis‚Äù*** VCAA
    - DNA is a long lived, stable molecule which resides in the nucleus.

# The Structure of Proteins

## Amino Acid

- What are the key components of amino acids? *(i.e. what do I need to be able to draw?)*
    - Variable Size Chain ( R group)
    - Amino group
    - Carboxylic Acid Group
    - Central Carbon / Hydrogen
    
<br> 

## The Hierarchy of Protein Structure

1. Primary:
    - The linear order/sequence of amino acids which is formed by covalent peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids

    
2. Secondary:
    - *‚Äúthe coiled or pleated structure within the chain (including Œ±-helices and Œ≤-pleated sheets)‚Äù VCAA* 
    - caused by hydrogen-bonding between -C=O and -N-H groups (peptide linkages) within the amino acid chain

3. Tertiary:
    - *VCAA 2013: ‚ÄúTertiary structure: A 3D structure composed of secondary structures‚Äù*
        - formed through the interactions of various ‚ÄòR‚Äô groups within the molecule
        - As the function of a protein is determined by its structure, the tertiary structure of a protein is essential to its functioning
    
4. Quaternary:
    - *VCAA 2013: ‚ÄúQuaternary structure: Two or more polypeptide chains joined together‚Äù*
    
    

# Today's TL;DR

- DNA is a super cool molecule that makes all of live possible
- DNA is a double stranded, antiparallel polymer of nucleotides
- Nucleotides are comprised of a phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, nitrogenous base and a hydroxyl group
- In comparison, RNA is single stranded, and it's nucleotides have a ribose sugar (and have Uracil rather than Thymine)
- Proteins are 3D dimensional folder polymer comprised of amino acid
- Amino acids are comprised of a central carbon, a variable group, a carboxylic acid group and a amine group

# Extra Resources:

The Fancy Terms about DNA to know for the VCE exam: 
1. Antiparallel
    - The two DNA strands run alongside each other in the opposite direction (with respect to the 5' phosphate and the 3' hydroxyl group)
2. Redundant
   - Multiple different DNA sequences can encode the same amino acid / protein
3. Degenerate
   - A change to a DNA sequence doesn't always result in a change to the protein it encodes
4. Condensation Polymerisation
   - The phosphodiester backbone of a DNA strand forms from the addition of nucleotides, resulting in the loss of water
5. Universal
    - The same DNA sequence encodes for the same protein no matter what organism it is in
6. Gene
   - A DNA sequence which encodes a specific protein product
7. Complementary Base Pairing
   - Particular nucleotides only ever pair up with each other using hydrogen bonds. (e.g. A - T, G - C)

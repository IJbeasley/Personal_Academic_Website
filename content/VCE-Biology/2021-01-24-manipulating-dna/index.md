Introduction to Gel Electrophoresis by Khan Academy 

</center> 

A technique used to separate DNA fragments ('bits of DNA') on the basis of their size/length. Gel electrophoresis can thus help us when we are comparing samples such as in forensic testing of DNA at crime scenes, and paternity testing (do we find DNA fragments of the same length?). Additionally, in laboratory research we can use it iscolate particular DNA fragments we are interested in (i.e. if we originally have a mix of fragments, but are only interested in one particular fragment). 

## Important Ideas:

- DNA is negatively charged (so attracted to positive end)
- Smaller DNA fragments move faster
- DNA fragments of the same length move at the same speed

<br> 

## Steps:

- DNA is extracted from cells/obtained from PCR
- Fragments of DNA are loaded into wells (in agar gel)
- The DNA is subjected to a electric current, with the negative end closest to the starting point of the DNA
- DNA fragments move toward the positively charged electrode (as DNA is negatively charged, due the phosphate group in its backbone)
- Smaller fragments are more easily able to move through the pores in the agar gel and thus move quicker (travel a further distance)
- DNA is treated with a chemical which causes the molecule to fluoresce
- Size can be calculated (in kilobases) by comparing against a known industry standard

Steps in PCR Khan Academy Introduction

A technique for amplifying DNA fragments exponentially through many cycles of multiplication.

### Amplification Questions 

If you initially started with one DNA fragment, how many DNA fragements will you have ...

- **D(enaturing)**

90Â° (hydrogen bonds between strands in broken, creating single stranded DNA molecules) [separation/complementary base pairing]

- **A(nnealing)**

50Â° (Primers are able to anneal/bind to the two DNA strands)

- **E(longation)**

72Â° (Taq polymerase attaches to the primer, and moves along the two template strands of DNA synthesizing a new strand of DNA from each of the two template strands (using complementary base pairing) from free nucleotides. \

<b> Note: </b> You might find your textbook/s, other resources, or teachers give different temperatures for each of these steps. None of these temperatures are 'wrong'; in practice the specific temperatures of each step will vary deepening on the machine used, and the kind of DNA fragment you are trying to amplify.

<br>
<br> 
In VCE exams, any temperatures listed in approved textbooks will be marked correct: <i> the most important aspect to get correct is the relative temperature of each step </i> (i.e., be able to answer the question: which step has the highest temperature?)

<br> 
<br>
For SACs it's best to stick to the temperatures you are taught by your teacher, or textbook.

# Today's TL;DR

- Gel electrophoresis is used to separate and compare DNA of different lengths
    - Smaller fragments are more easily able to move through the pores in the agar gel and thus move quicker
- PCR is used to amplify DNA fragments
    - Main steps: Denaturation, Anneal, and Elongation (which repeat in cycles)

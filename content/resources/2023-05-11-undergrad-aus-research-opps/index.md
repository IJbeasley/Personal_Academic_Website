As an undergraduate student, I really wanted to get involved in research but struggled to find what opportunities were available to me. Often I'd discover them right after I the deadline for applications had passed. When this happened, I saved the rough details of when / where to apply into a word document so I'd hopefully be prepared when the opportunity arose to apply again. 

Recently, I was asked by a undergraduate student how they might be able to get involved in research as a student. This question prompted me to go back and find my old list of possible undergraduate research opportunities in the BioSciences or Biomedical Sciences. I've updated this list below, and hopefully sharing it here helps another Australian student in their quest to get more research experience (it is currently very Melbourne, and undergraduate student focused though I'm afraid!). 

Keep in mind the information below may no longer be accurate, and these programs may not be running (and newer programs will likely exist). Please check the program links (and Google if the links have expired) for the latest application deadline, eligibility criteria and program information.

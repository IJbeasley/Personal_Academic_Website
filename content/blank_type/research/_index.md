Currently, my master's research is focused on using machine learning to investigate what genetic associations (specifically eQTLs) are shared across populations (more here).

Previously, I have helped develop a Bayesian method for testing differential mRNA abundance, [TABI]({{< relref "/project/TABI" >}}). Additionally, I have worked with evolutionary models to explore the evolution of palindromes on X chromosomes and collated datasets to test for the overlap of sexually antagonistic variants and inversions.

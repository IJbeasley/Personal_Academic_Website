<h2 style = "color:black" > Research Projects Overview </h2>

My current research explores the impact of different metrics on the portability of one type of genetic association: expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). This work builds on insights gained during <a href="/project/pop_spec_eqtl"  style="color:#D90429"> my master's research at Melbourne University</a>; while training machine learning models to predict eQTL portability across human populations, I realised power was a significant confounder to the accurate interpretation of many studies.

Before my master's, I contributed to work testing two evolutionary theories at Monash University (<a href= "/project/monash_journalclub" style="color:#D90429">'Unguarded X'</a> and <a href= "/project/monash-winter" style="color:#D90429"> genomic location of maintained sexually antagonistic variants</a>). Additionally, researchers at WEHI shaped my coding practices by supervising my undergraduate research project: adapting a Bayesian model and R-package for testing differential mRNA abundance (<a href="/project/TABI" style="color:#D90429">TABI</a>).

Currently, 

As an undergraduate I spent a year working part time in the [Papenfuss Laboratory](https://papenfusslab.org/) of the Bioinformatics department of the [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research](https://www.wehi.edu.au/). Under the supervision of [Dr. Stefano Mangiola](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=xusyqjoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Tony Papenfuss](https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/tony-papenfuss),  I assisted in the development of a Bayesian inference model for differential gene expression analysis, [TABI]({{< relref "/project/TABI" >}}).  
[More detail and explanation here]({{< relref "/project/TABI" >}})

I also received a [scholarship](https://www.monash.edu/study/fees-scholarships/scholarships/summer-winter) from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) to undertake a month length vacation project in the [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/biological-sciences) under the supervision of Dr. Filip Ruzicka and Dr. Tim Connallon. This project focused on the initial investigation of overlap between inversions and sexually antagonistic genes.  [More detail and explanation here]({{< relref "/project/monash-winter" >}})

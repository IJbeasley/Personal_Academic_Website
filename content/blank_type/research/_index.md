Currently, my master's research is focused on using machine learning to investigate what genetic associations (specifically eQTLs) are shared across populations (more [here]({{< relref "/project/pop_spec_eqtl" >}})). I've presented work on this project at a few conferences: to see some of the abstracts and materials used for these conferences see [here](#talk). 

Previously, I have helped develop a Bayesian method for testing differential mRNA abundance, [TABI]({{< relref "/project/TABI" >}}). Additionally, I have worked with evolutionary models to explore the [evolution of palindromes on X chromosomes]({{< relref "/project/monash_internship" >}}) and collated datasets to test for the [overlap of sexually antagonistic variants and inversions]({{< relref "/project/monash-winter" >}}).

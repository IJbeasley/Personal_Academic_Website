<h2 style = "color:black" > Overview & Introduction: </h2>

Currently, my master's research is focused on using machine learning to investigate what genetic associations (specifically eQTLs) are shared across populations  (<a href="/project/pop_spec_eqtl"  style="color:#D90429">more information here</a>). I've presented work on this project at a few conferences: to see some of the abstracts and materials used for these conferences see <a href="/research/#talks"  style="color:#D90429">here</a>. 

Previously, I have helped develop a Bayesian method for testing differential mRNA abundance, 
<a href="/project/TABI" style="color:#D90429">TABI</a>. Additionally, I have worked with evolutionary models to explore <a href="/project/monash_internship" style="color:#D90429"> the evolution of palindromes on X chromosomes </a> and collated datasets to test for the <a href="/project/monash-winter" style="color:#D90429"> overlap of sexually antagonistic variants and inversions </a>.

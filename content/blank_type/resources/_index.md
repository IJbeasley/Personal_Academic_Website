<h2 style = "color:black" > Overview & Introduction: </h2>

Currently, my <a href="/project/pop_spec_eqtl"  style="color:#D90429"> master's research</a> is focused on using machine learning to investigate what genetic associations (specifically eQTLs) are shared across populations. I've presented work from this project at a few conferences: to see some of the materials used for these conferences see <a href="/research/#talks"  style="color:#D90429">here</a>. 

Previously, I have helped develop a Bayesian method for testing differential mRNA abundance, 
<a href="/project/TABI" style="color:#D90429">TABI</a>. Additionally, I have worked with evolutionary models to explore <a href="/project/monash_internship" style="color:#D90429"> the evolution of palindromes on X chromosomes </a> and collated datasets to test for the <a href="/project/monash-winter" style="color:#D90429"> overlap of sexually antagonistic variants and inversions</a>.

I'm a Master of Science Student within the School of BioSciences at Melbourne University. Under the supervision of [Dr. Irene Gallego Romero](https://igr-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au/) and [Dr. Christina Azodi](https://www.svi.edu.au/research_themes/research_staff/christina_azodi), my Masters research is focusing on using machine learning methods to predict whether known genetic associations in humans (specifically eQTLs) are consistent across populations (more [here](../project/pop_spec_eqtl/)). I'm also passionate about science communication and improving educational access; I aim to support disadvantaged high school students through providing debating coaching, lecturing and [learning materials](vce-biology).
